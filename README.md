# RatsVR
An animal physiology exploration tool for high school education.

This is currently being developed in Unity, using the VRTK open source VR tool. For now, it has been intended to run on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers, but there is the ability to quickly refactor for the HTC Vive and with more effort, produce a Google Cardboard (or similar) app.

At this time, being a Unity project filled with binaries, we are not using Git for version control but rather Unity Collaborate. This means that our project files including all of our code is not currently available here, but this may change in the future. Lookout for updtes on our project here or on our website [mizuinteractive.com](mizuinteractive.com).
